This is a simple, lightweight API designed to do one thing and do it well: serve up curated lists of the top 10 books across various genres.
🚀 Why did I build this?
I wanted to test out a free to use API i had found earlier and see what i will be able to do with it. The insipartion came from a post i read on extracting book information form an excel sheet using a library in python so i thought "why not build it with an API and use real time data instead?"
